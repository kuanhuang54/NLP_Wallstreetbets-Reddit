# NLP_Wallstreetbets-Reddit-Analysis

### According to the unofficial traffic-tracking site:

#### r/WallStreetBets has seen an unsurprisingly massive spike in visits and interest over the past weeks. Yesterday, the subreddit counted a pathetic 4 million subscribers. Overnight, however, over 1.5 million new accounts jumped aboard, bringing the total to around 5.5 million at the time of writing this. Compare that to the beginning of 2021, when r/WallStreetBets saw about 1.7 million total subscriptions. We're not math whizzes or anything, but if we're figuring this right, r/WallStreetBets added the same number of people overnight that it began with this year in total.

### This project digs deeper into this fluctuation using sentiment analysis and NLP.
